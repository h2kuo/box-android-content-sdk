Box Android Content SDK
===================

This SDK makes it easy to use Box's [Content API](https://developers.box.com/docs/) in your Android projects.

Quickstart
----------
Step 1: Add the SDK to your project

The SDK can be obtained by adding it as a maven dependency, cloning the source into your project, or by downloading one of the precompiled JARs from the releases page on GitHub.

This SDK has the following dependencies and will need to be included if you use the JAR:
* minimal-json v0.9.1 (for maven: com.eclipsesource.minimal-json:minimal-json:0.9.1)

Step 2: Set the Box Client ID and Client Secret that you obtain from [creating a developer account](http://developers.box.com/)
```java
BoxConfig.CLIENT_ID = "your-client-id";
BoxConfig.CLIENT_SECRET = "your-client-secret";
```

Step 3: Authenticate a User
```java
// This will present the necessary UI for a user to authenticate into Box. 
// Pass in the current context.
BoxSession session = new BoxSession(MainActivity.this);
session.authenticate();
```

Sample App
----------
A sample app can be found in the [box-content-sample](box-content-sample) folder. The sample app demonstrates how to authenticate a user, view the user's files and folders, and upload a file.
